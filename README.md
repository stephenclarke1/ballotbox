# BALLOT BOX

This website is set up with a src folder, with all of the template .njk files and .md files, which get turned into .html files with seperate folders (for clean URLs) that live in the public folder. This gets published by netlify onto **[ballotboxnz.netlify.app](https://ballotboxnz.netlify.app)**

Apologies, but due to limitations associated with cost, I have to manually update the charts every day to keep them updated with new data, so depending on when you look at it the mock election will probably not update to your inputs. Really sorry about that.
