# Music Department Website

Hello!

This website is set up with a src folder, with all of the template (.njk) files and .md files, which get turned into .html files with seperate folders (for clean URLs) that live in the public folder. This gets published by netlify onto **[onslowmusic.netlify.app](https://onslowmusic.netlify.app)**

When a new file is created on the CMS (**[onslowmusic.netlify.app/admin](https://onslowmusic.netlify.app/admin)**, there are login details on the teams assignment), it gets put into the correct folder in src as a .md file and gets generated into an html file in the public folder by 11ty.

Other than that, its pretty self-explanatory. I was somewhat limited by my lack of skills in JavaScript, so thats why there are some weird folder structures and strange things.
