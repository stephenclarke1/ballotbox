On the morning of the 27th of September, members of the Studio Orchestra piled on to the train, and made their way to Wellington College, for this was the day of the MEFA. After waiting for some time, it was our turn to workshop one of our songs with Dr Robert McWilliams, a musician from Australia. It was a great learning experience, and we were able to iron out some of the creases with the song.<div class="img-container"><img src="/assets/images/MEFA-2022-featured.jpg" alt="A picture of the Studio Orchestra in September 2022."><p class="img-caption">Image: Lily Harward-Jones</p></div>

After the workshop, there was a bit more waiting, but soon enough, it was time for us to perform. We performed three of our songs that we've been working on this year, Sir Duke by Stevie Wonder, Cool by Leonard Bernstein and American Patrol by Frank Meacham.
All in all, MEFA was a great experience, and I look forward to next year's installment. If you're interested, you can watch the <a href="/posts/videos/2022-10-12-MEFA-2022/">archived livestream</a> of the event.
