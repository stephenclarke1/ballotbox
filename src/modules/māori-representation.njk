        <p>In 1840, more than 500 Māori rangatira signed <i>te Tiriti o Waitangi</i> (The Treaty of Waitangi), an agreement between tangata whenua and the British crown. There are two versions of the treaty, one in English and one in te reo Māori, which means there are some not insignificant differences with the phrasing and language used.</p>
        <p>To simplify years of work by experts on how interperet this document, the European version said that the Crown would get sovereignty over the land, ‘exclusive and undisturbed possession' of Māori land, while the te reo Māori version says that the crown would get governance over the land, and that Māori would be guaranteed tino rangatiratanga - full rights of chieftainship over their whenua and taonga. It is worth mentioning that the vast majority of Māori who signed the treaty signed the te reo version.</p>
        <p>This resulted in years of conflict, land being stolen, erasure of Māori culture, and other acts of colonisation by Pākehā. In 1854, Aotearoa New Zealand adopted the British system of democracy, and until 1867, Māori could only vote if they were men who were the sole owners of land. This resulted in many Māori, who didn't own their land outright, not being able to vote. This was changed in 1867, with the creation of four <i>Māori electorates</i> (out of 70 seats total), and all Māori men could vote.</p>

        <h2>Māori Roll</h2>
    </header>
    <p>Māori have the choice to either be on the Māori roll or the general roll, which determines whether your electorate vote is for the general electorate or Māori electorate you live in.</p>
    <p>Under the current legislation, Māori can choose to switch to the other roll if they want to <b>at any time</b> unless there are three months until an election (local or national). Before this legislation came about in 2023, Māori could choose when they first enrolled, then would only be able to change rolls once every five years.</p>
