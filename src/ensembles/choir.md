The school choir meets on a Monday lunchtime. All are welcome! It is a very happy lively time, and we sing at a range of events across the school year. Chamber choir is a smaller ensemble that meets after school once a week and is for those who really want to take their singing a little more seriously.

### Big Choir

The big choir meets each Monday at lunchtime, in [MS2](/contact#schoolmap). The choir features from many different backgrounds and levels of experiences, and is open to any student, regardless of experience.

Come along to a session, we're always on the look out for new singers!

### Chamber Choir

The chamber choir meets each Friday after school, in [MS2](/contact#schoolmap). The choir is auditioned, and features our more experienced singers. If you want to join, [contact Katherinie](/contact#teachers).
